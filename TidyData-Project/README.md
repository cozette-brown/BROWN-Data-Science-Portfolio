# **üíµ Tidy Data Project: Federal R&D Budget**

***Tidy Data Project: Federal R&D Budget*** applies the principles of tidy data in order to tidy a Federal R&D Budget dataset ('fed_rd_year&gdp.csv') and create data visualizations from the tidied data, using a Jupyter Notebook.<br><br>
The objective is for viewers of the tidied dataset to be able to visualize the data in two meaningful ways:
1. **Comparatively by Department:** See changes over time within a department, or compare departments for each fiscal year.
2. **As a Percentage of GDP:** See changes in the total budgeted for R&D as a percentage of US GDP over time.
