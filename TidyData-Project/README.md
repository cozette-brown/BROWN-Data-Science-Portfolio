# **üíµ Tidy Data Project: Federal R&D Budget**

***Tidy Data Project: Federal R&D Budget*** applies the principles of tidy data in order to tidy a Federal R&D Budget dataset ('fed_rd_year&gdp.csv') and create data visualizations from the tidied data, all within one Jupyter Notebook.<br><br>
The objective is for viewers of the tidied dataset to be able to visualize the data in two meaningful ways:
1. **By Year:** See the amount budgeted to each department for a single year
2. **By Department:** See the amount budgeted to a single department for each year
