My portfolio for *MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science* at the University of Notre Dame. Includes course notes and exercises, plus the following projects:

### 1. My First Streamlit App: James Bond Franchise ([view here](https://github.com/cozette-brown/BROWN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/45df5288c5c65b926761bc3010556b5a969bd744/basic_streamlit_app))
This Streamlit app provides a way to explore similarities and differences between films in the James Bond franchise. It incorporates basic elements of Streamlit app development, with room for further improvement as I learn additional capabilities using Streamlit and other packages. <br><br>
**Tools & Skills Showcased:**
* Python
* Pandas
* Streamlit

### 2. Tidy Data Project: Federal R&D Budget ([view here](https://github.com/cozette-brown/BROWN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/45df5288c5c65b926761bc3010556b5a969bd744/TidyData-Project))
This project in Jupyter Notebooks applies the principles of tidy data in order to prepare a provided dataset for analysis and create meaningful data visualizations from it. In step-by-step format, I showcase how I've learned to use tidy data principles, which are a vital part of making datasets usable for real-world analysis. <br><br>
**Tools & Skills Showcased:**
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

### 3. Machine Learning App ([view here](https://github.com/cozette-brown/BROWN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp))
This Streamlit app allows users to use various machine learning models, experiment with hyperparameters, and evaluate models using either sample datasets or their own uploaded file. It integrates what I've learned so far about machine learning and creating meaningful visualizations, such as confusion matrices, to understand and convey important information about data.<br><br>
**Tools & Skills Showcased:**
* Python
* Streamlit
* Machine Learning w/ Sklearn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
