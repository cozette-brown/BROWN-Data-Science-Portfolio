My portfolio for *MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science* at the University of Notre Dame. Includes course notes and exercises, plus the following projects:

### 1. My First Streamlit App: James Bond Franchise ([view here](https://github.com/cozette-brown/BROWN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/45df5288c5c65b926761bc3010556b5a969bd744/basic_streamlit_app))
This Streamlit app provides a way to explore similarities and differences between films in the James Bond franchise. It incorporates basic elements of Streamlit app development, with room for further improvement as I learn additional capabilities using Streamlit and other packages. <br><br>
**Tools & Skills Showcased:**
* Python
* Pandas
* Streamlit

### 2. Tidy Data Project: Federal R&D Budget ([view here](https://github.com/cozette-brown/BROWN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/45df5288c5c65b926761bc3010556b5a969bd744/TidyData-Project))
This project in Jupyter Notebooks applies the principles of tidy data in order to prepare a provided dataset for analysis and create meaningful data visualizations from it.<br><br>
**Tools & Skills Showcased:**
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

### 3. Machine Learning App ([view here](https://github.com/cozette-brown/BROWN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)
This Streamlit app allows users to use various machine learning models, experiment with hyperparameters, and evaluate models using either sample datasets or their own uploaded file.<br><br>
**Tools & Skills Showcased:**
* Python
* Streamlit
* Machine Learning w/ Sklearn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
