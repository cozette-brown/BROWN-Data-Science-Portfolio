# Basic Streamlit App

This basic Streamlit app reads data from a CSV file that contains facts about every movie in the James Bond franchise. It uses interactive double-slider and multiselect widgets in order to display a filtered view of a dataframe created from the CSV file. 

### Instructions for Running Streamlit:

1) With basic_streamlit_app downloaded and open in VS Code, open your terminal (if you are not already in basic_streamlit_app, use "ls" and "cd" commands to navigate to it from within your terminal).
2) Type "ls" in your terminal. You should now see REAME.md, data, and main.py listed inside your terminal.
3) Type "streamlit run main.py" to run the app.
4) BONUS: In order to see the app from within VS Code, copy the Streamlit localhost URL, click the search bar at top of window -> hit "Show and Run Commands" -> hit "Simple Browser: Show" -> paste copied URL and hit enter/return.

***Example Path:***

BROWN-Data-Science-Portfolio open in VS Code -> type "ls" and hit return then "cd basic_streamlit_app" and hit return in terminal -> type "ls" and hit return then "streamlit run main.py" and hit return -> copy URL in terminal -> click search bar where it says "BROWN-Data-Science-Portfolio" -> click "Show and Run Commands" -> click "Simple Browser: Show" -> paste copied URL and hit return -> open split screen to see code side-by-side with Streamlit display<br><br>
